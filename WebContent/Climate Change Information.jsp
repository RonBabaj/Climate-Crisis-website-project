		<br/><br/>
		The Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.

		<br/>There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times.
		<br/>
		This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy.
</br><br/>
Solar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions.
<br/>
This heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.
<br/>
Scientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature.
<br/>
This is known as climate change or global warming.

<br/><br/>

		<font color="white" size="4">
		The greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.
<br/>
Carbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. <br/>It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.
<br/>
Most man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels.<br/> <br/>When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming.<br/>

Since the Industrial Revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%.<br/> The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.
<br/>
Other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.

<br/><br/>

		The world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
</br>
It says the past five years, 2015–2019, were the warmest on record.
</br></br>
Across the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.
</br>
Most of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.
</br></br>
However, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.
</br></br>
And satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years.
</br>
Satellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass.</br> A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.
The effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. </br>These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.

<h2 align="center"> <font color="white" size="13"><b>How Will Climate Change Affect Us?<br/></b></font></h2>
<br/><br/>
		<p align="justify">
		<font color="white" size="4">
There is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be.
<br/> 
It could cause fresh water shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves.<br/>
 This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.
 <br/> As the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air.<br/> 
 <br/> This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. 
<br/>  But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. 
 <br/> But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.
 <br/> <br/>Poorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most.
<br/>
Plant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. 
<br/>And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.
<br/>
As more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. <br/>
This could pose major problems for coral reefs.<br/>
</br>
Global warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating. 
<br/>This includes the release of large quantities of methane as permafrost - frozen soil found mainly at high latitudes - melts.

Responding to climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face this century.
